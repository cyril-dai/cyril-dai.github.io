During this session, we thought about algorithms to operate the components, for this, we first wrote our algorithms on paper, then we used the very famous software Flowcode V6, that only students of Terminal STI2S know (• ᴗ •) to check the functioning of our algorithm. During this session, we started by thinking about the algorithm for the water flow sensor and the temperature sensor.',"Project stage two description 02":"We spent the whole hour trying to find the right algorithm for the temperature sensor, we did various research on the internet, it turns out that we had to use one-wire.","Project stage two description 03":"During this session, we were at the 1st review of the project, the teachers watched the progress of the project and we showed them our specifications and algorithms, they then gave us their opinions on what works and what does will not help, while helping us to correct errors and improve certain points. After discussing the project, we started the presence sensor algorithm and are still trying to find an algorithm that would work with the temperature sensor.","Project stage two description 04":"We have completed the presence sensor algorithm and are starting the LCD screen algorithm. We decided to add an LED in the project, to allow the hearing impaired to also manage their water consumption because at the start of the project, we had only thought of an audible indicator without having thought of those who were having trouble to hear, hence the idea of adding an LED to the project. We also received, all our components today, we were waiting to finish all the algorithms, before testing them on the components.","Project stage two description 05":"We continue the algorithm of the LCD screen and started the last algorithm to do, the soap dispenser connected to the system.","Project stage two description 06":"We have finished the algorithm of the LCD screen and the algorithm of the soap dispenser connected to the system. With the time remaining, we started to think about the different connections of the components.","Project stage two problems 01":"The one-wire tool did not integrate into the Flowcode V6 software, so we had to import an algorithm found on the internet to be able to use the one-wire on Flowcode.","Project stage two problems 02":"We had found an algorithm for the temperature sensor, but we had to wait for the reception of the component, in order to test it.","Project stage two next 01":"We will continue and finish the temperature sensor algorithm.","Project stage two next 02":"We will start the algorithm of the presence sensor and we will make the 1st project review, then we will try to finish the algorithm of the temperature sensor.","Project stage two next 03":"We will finish the presence sensor algorithm and start the LCD screen algorithm.","Project stage two next 04":"We will continue the algorithm of the LCD screen and start the algorithm of the soap dispenser connected to the system.","Project stage two next 05":'We will end the part "Detailed design" by finishing all the algorithms of the project.',"Project stage two next 06":'We will start the "Modeling-Prototyping" part of the project.',"Project stage three description 01":"We have started mounting the temperature sensor, water flow sensor, sound indicator, LED and electric water pumps.","Project stage three description 02":"We finished the montages of the previous session.","Project stage three description 03":"We have started the assembly of the LCD display and the flow sensor.","Project stage three description 04":"We have successfully completed the assembly of the LCD display and the presence sensor.
